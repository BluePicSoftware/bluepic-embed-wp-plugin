## Description

This block makes it easy to embed bluepic templates.

## Installation

### (1) Download the latest plugin

[Download latest Bluepic Embed Wordpress Plugin](https://github.com/BluePicSoftware/bluepic-embed-wp-plugin/releases/download/v0.1.1/bluepic-embed.zip)

You also find all releases on our [here](https://github.com/BluePicSoftware/bluepic-embed-wp-plugin/releases)

### (2) Upload plugin

1. Click on the **"Plugins"** menu item in the sidebar of your wordpress admin panel
2. Click on the button **"Add New Plugin"**
3. Click on the button **"Upload Plugin"**
4. Upload the ZIP file you just downloaded
5. Click on the **"Install Now"** button
6. CLick on the **"Activate Plugin"** button

### (3) Authorize your bluepic account

To make embedding templates easy as possible, you should connect your Bluepic account with your wordpress instance. You can use the plugin without this but than you need to paste the _project ids_ manually.

1. Navigate to the new **"Bluepic Settings"** menu in your sidebar
2. Click on **"Authenticate with Bluepic"** and authorize the app

### (4) Use the new block

Within the Gutenberg-Editor, you now will find the new **Bluepic Embed** block which lets you embed bluepic templates. You can either type in a project id manually or select one of your projects (if authenticated with Bluepic)

### Notes

The authentication will expire. To refresh it, just revisit the **"Bluepic Settings page"**

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/bluepic-embed` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
